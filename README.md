# Hello

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to BeepSquares

ðŸŽ¶ This is a fun little sequencer which makes use of the tone.js library to allow users to write and share music ðŸŽ¶
The fun thing with _this_ sequencer is that it allows you to easily try out your track in all the modes of the major and harmonic minor scale.
I made this to get more familiar with the sound of different modes - maybe you can use it to get more familiar with modes yourself ðŸ˜Š

## Getting started

First up, run `npm install` from the root folder to sort out any dependencies.
Then run `npm run start` to get going.

## Deployments

The site is hosted on Azure Static Web Apps, over [here](https://www.beepsquares.com/).

Any Pull Requests will deploy a test env, which can be found on the PR in GitHub.

## Contributing

The TODO.md file has a vague backlog which can be used for finding things to do.
