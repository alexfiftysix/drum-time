### Doing:
- [ ] [TECH] Share links are very long and ugly, and there is definitely a way to make them less horrible

### To Do:
- [ ] MIDI export
  - It would be great to be able to export this midi, import it to a DAW and play with more sounds
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Check out the Deluge synth (a hardware synth with similar interface)
- [ ] Allow different length sequences
- [ ] Label each row with a scale degree/drum
- [ ] Swing traditionally goes from -50 to 50
- [ ] Random feature per sequencer - adds some random notes in
- [ ] Left/centre align things which can move around, so that the controls don't move when you change length 
- ------ Prioritized below here ------
- [ ] [BUG] Share button only copies the song-data, not the tempo/swing
- [ ] Name it!
  - Dotify? Like Spotify but it's dots??
- [ ] [BUG] It goes out of sync if you tab in/out while it's playing
- [ ] Volume slider
  - [ ] Individual volume slider per sequencer
- [ ] Reset on corrupted SongData in URL 
- [ ] [TECH/BUG/ONGOING] Performance! How do we make this thing run better?
- [ ] Play note on click when paused
- [ ] [TECH] Combine drums and treble and bass into one object somehow
- [ ] More scales
- [ ] [BUG] Looks like yer drums are backwards
- [ ] Some keyboard control
  - [ ] Space to go/stop
  - [ ] Arrow keys to go up/down/left/right on sequencerCells
- [ ] Allow scales with different note counts
- [ ] sharp and flat scales
- [ ] Repair corrupted SongData in URL
  - i.e, rather than ditching the whole thing on corrupt, take what you can and put the rest in the default state
- [ ] Delete old sequencers
- [ ] [BUG] Why am I seeing 38 rows rendered in logging and only 19 are visible?
- [ ] Make a transport bar
- [ ] Multiple sequences, which can be switched between on the fly

### Done:
- [x] Generally somewhat prettier colours
- [x] Update the readme
- [x] Scale/Transport controls can live to the side, so they are always accessible
  - Collapse on smaller screens to above/below
- [x] Ultra wide screen support
- [x] [BUG] After clear, note count resets to 8 but note-count text box still shows previous count
- [x] [BUG] Doesn't store tempo count in URL
- [x] [BUG] 'size' should be called 'length'
- [x] [BUG] Doesn't store length in URL
- [x] [BUG] Web site created using create-react-app
- [x] [BUG] Is it broken on Chromium?
  - Chrome is waiting for user input to allow the audio context
    - Hit start does that, but doesn't allow play.
    - Now hitting start 'stops', but it should start.
  - Add another button earlier on just for a 'let me in' step
  - OR actually look to see if your playing on the StopGo button
  - Solution was to start the audio context (separate from starting the song)
- [x] [BUG] Pretty sure your useDebounce is a mess. https://dev.to/rajeshroyal/how-to-make-a-custom-debounce-hook-in-react-js-4gcc
  - [x] [BUG] Big problems! Why are the notes no longer playing consistently?
- [x] [BUG] When switching note count by a lot, note on/offs get a bit screwed
  - Because when you type 16, it's switching to 1, then to 16 (so losing everything after 1)
  - Debounce the set slightly to make up for that
- [x] [BUG] Buffer not set or not loaded on change
- [x] Animate favicon while playing
- [x] [BUG] The first harmonic minor mode isn't ionian
- [x] Allow different note counts
  - [x] Update note count visualization right away
- [x] Title / favicon
- [x] Save and Load
  - [x] Store major vs minor in the URL
  - [x] Store start note in URL
  - [x] Store mode in URL
  - [x] Store tempo in URL
  - [x] Store swing in URL
  - [x] Store the treble notes in URL
    - Methinks lzstring is a good option https://www.npmjs.com/package/lz-string
      - Turns out it's not - can use atob() and btoa() instead.
      - TSPlayground has a 'share' button which triggers compression + saves into the URL
  - [x] Store the bass notes in URL
  - [x] Store the drums in URL
    - [x] Bring back the drums
  - [x] Find a better way to deal with treble and bass
    - This should work:
      - song = {..., sequencers: [{name: "treble", ...}, {name: "bass"}]}
  - [x] Add a clear button - Now that refresh doesn't clear
  - [x] Add a Share link (just needs to make sure the URL is fresh, and copy it to the clipboard)
- [x] Modes
  - [x] Change notes to midi
  - [x] Change scale def to [2, 1, 2] (semitones) style
  - [x] For modes, rotate the scale def
- [x] [BUG] Fix the beat marker
  - Do I need to store the state in mobx, and update the sequencer accordingly?
- [x] [BUG] All components should be visible on load
- [x] Swing
- [x] [BUG] What happened to the bass?
  - Need to change scale once for the notes to be in the right octaves ðŸ¤”
- [x] [BUG] Why are modes changing the octave so much?
