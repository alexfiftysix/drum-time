### Done:
- [x] [BUG] Web site created using create-react-app
- [x] [BUG] Is it broken on Chromium?
  - Chrome is waiting for user input to allow the audio context
    - Hit start does that, but doesn't allow play.
    - Now hitting start 'stops', but it should start.
  - Add another button earlier on just for a 'let me in' step
  - OR actually look to see if your playing on the StopGo button
  - Solution was to start the audio context (separate from starting the song)
- [x] [BUG] Pretty sure your useDebounce is a mess. https://dev.to/rajeshroyal/how-to-make-a-custom-debounce-hook-in-react-js-4gcc
  - [x] [BUG] Big problems! Why are the notes no longer playing consistently?
- [x] [BUG] When switching note count by a lot, note on/offs get a bit screwed
  - Because when you type 16, it's switching to 1, then to 16 (so losing everything after 1)
  - Debounce the set slightly to make up for that
- [x] [BUG] Buffer not set or not loaded on change
- [x] Animate favicon while playing
- [x] [BUG] The first harmonic minor mode isn't ionian
- [x] Allow different note counts
  - [x] Update note count visualization right away
- [x] Title / favicon
- [x] Save and Load
  - [x] Store major vs minor in the URL
  - [x] Store start note in URL
  - [x] Store mode in URL
  - [x] Store tempo in URL
  - [x] Store swing in URL
  - [x] Store the treble notes in URL
    - Methinks lzstring is a good option https://www.npmjs.com/package/lz-string
      - Turns out it's not - can use atob() and btoa() instead.
      - TSPlayground has a 'share' button which triggers compression + saves into the URL
  - [x] Store the bass notes in URL
  - [x] Store the drums in URL
    - [x] Bring back the drums
  - [x] Find a better way to deal with treble and bass
    - This should work:
      - song = {..., sequencers: [{name: "treble", ...}, {name: "bass"}]}
  - [x] Add a clear button - Now that refresh doesn't clear
  - [x] Add a Share link (just needs to make sure the URL is fresh, and copy it to the clipboard)
- [x] Modes
  - [x] Change notes to midi
  - [x] Change scale def to [2, 1, 2] (semitones) style
  - [x] For modes, rotate the scale def
- [x] [BUG] Fix the beat marker
  - Do I need to store the state in mobx, and update the sequencer accordingly?
- [x] [BUG] All components should be visible on load
- [x] Swing
- [x] [BUG] What happened to the bass?
  - Need to change scale once for the notes to be in the right octaves ðŸ¤”
- [x] [BUG] Why are modes changing the octave so much?
